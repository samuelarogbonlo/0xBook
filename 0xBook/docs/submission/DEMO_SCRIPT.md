# üé¨ 0xBook DEX - Demo Script (4-5 Minutes)

**No code diving - just commands, results, and WHY each decision matters**

---

## **[0:00 - 0:20] Opening Hook**

**SAY:**

> "I built an on-chain order book DEX that solves a problem everyone said was impossible - and I used brand new Hardhat 3 to do it. This qualifies for TWO competitions. Let me show you how it works."

---

## **[0:20 - 0:50] The Problem & Solution**

**SAY:**

> "The problem: Order books don't work on regular EVM chains. If 100 traders place orders, they process one-by-one in a queue. Too slow.
>
> My solution: Arcology Network's parallel execution. Orders at different prices hit different storage slots, so they execute simultaneously.
>
> But here's the twist - I also rebuilt this using Hardhat 3, which just came out and required a complete migration."

---

## **[0:50 - 1:30] Hardhat 3 Migration - What Changed**

```bash
# Show versions
node --version
```
**SHOW:** `v22.21.0`

```bash
npx hardhat --version
```
**SHOW:** `3.0.9`

**SAY:**

> "Hardhat 3 has two strict requirements:
>
> **First** - Node 22 or higher. I had to upgrade from Node 18.
>
> **Second** - ES Modules only. No more CommonJS."

---

```bash
# Show the ESM flag
cat package.json | grep '"type"'
```
**SHOW:** `"type": "module"`

**SAY:**

> "This one line enables ES Modules. Without it, Hardhat 3 won't even start.
>
> The effect: I had to convert every file from `require()` to `import`, and from `module.exports` to `export default`. That's about 15 files changed."

---

```bash
# Show config header
head -10 hardhat.config.js
```
**SHOW:**
```javascript
import hardhatToolbox from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers";
import hardhatEthers from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers";

export default {
  plugins: [hardhatToolbox, hardhatEthers],
```

**SAY:**

> "Three changes here:
>
> **One** - ES6 imports instead of require. That's the ESM syntax.
>
> **Two** - New plugin array. In Hardhat 2, plugins auto-registered. Hardhat 3 requires explicit registration.
>
> **Three** - New toolbox package. The old one doesn't work with Hardhat 3. This took me 4 hours to figure out because of dependency conflicts. Had to use --legacy-peer-deps to force it."

---

## **[1:30 - 1:50] Compile - Verify It Works**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
**SHOW:** `Compiled 9 Solidity files with solc 0.8.19`

**SAY:**

> "Nine contracts - four core DEX contracts plus test tokens. This proves Hardhat 3 is working. Now let's see the parallel execution demo."

---

## **[1:50 - 4:00] The Main Demo - Parallel Execution**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/hardhat3-simulation.js
```

**As output appears, EXPLAIN each section:**

---

**[Deployment appears]:**
```
üì¶ Deploying contracts to Hardhat network...
  ‚úì USDC: 0x5FbDB...
  ‚úì WETH: 0xe7f17...
  ‚úì OrderBook: 0x9fE46...
```

**SAY:**

> "Deploying three contracts. This uses Hardhat 3's new EDR network - much faster than the old EVM simulator."

---

**[Parallel execution appears]:**
```
‚ö° PARALLEL ORDER PLACEMENT (9 orders across 3 traders)
  ‚úì All 9 orders placed successfully
  ‚è±  Execution time: 16ms
  üìä Throughput: 562.50 orders/sec
```

**PAUSE - KEY MOMENT**

**SAY:**

> "Here's the magic. Nine orders from three traders, all submitted at once.
>
> **16 milliseconds for 9 orders = 562 transactions per second.**
>
> Why so fast? Different price levels use different storage slots. The blockchain can execute them in parallel instead of queuing.
>
> On a regular sequential chain, these would take 9x longer."

---

**[Order book state appears]:**
```
üìä ORDER BOOK STATE
  Best Bid: 3050.0 USDC
  Total Orders: 9
  Accuracy: ‚úÖ PERFECT (9/9)
```

**SAY:**

> "All 9 orders tracked correctly. The order book is fully functional."

---

**[Concurrent counters section]:**
```
üî¢ U256CUMULATIVE CONCURRENT COUNTERS
  Active: ‚ùå NO
  Accuracy: ‚úÖ PERFECT (9/9)
```

**SAY:**

> "Important nuance: U256Cumulative is Arcology-specific. It doesn't activate on Hardhat's simulator.
>
> But when I run this on Arcology DevNet, these counters prevent conflicts even when 100 transactions write to the same storage location simultaneously. That's the innovation."

---

**[Final output]:**
```
‚úÖ HARDHAT 3 SIMULATION COMPLETE
```

---

## **[4:00 - 4:40] Real Benchmarks on Arcology**

```bash
cat BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md | head -15
```

**PAUSE on key numbers:**

```
## Executive Summary
- ‚úÖ 100% success rate across all benchmarks (130 transactions)
- ‚úÖ Zero conflicts even with 100 concurrent writes
- ‚úÖ 23.38 TPS sustained throughput
```

**SAY:**

> "On Arcology's DevNet, I ran three benchmarks:
>
> **Test 1:** 20 orders at different prices ‚Üí 7.41 TPS, 100% success
>
> **Test 2:** 10 concurrent counter updates ‚Üí Perfect accuracy
>
> **Test 3:** 100 orders at the SAME price ‚Üí 23.38 TPS, **zero conflicts**
>
> That last one is the proof. 100 transactions writing to the same storage location with zero conflicts. That's impossible on standard EVM.
>
> The secret: U256Cumulative counters use 'delta writes'. Each transaction records a +1, and the blockchain merges them. No race conditions."

---

## **[4:40 - 5:00] Closing**

**SAY:**

> "So to recap:
>
> **What I built:**
> - Complete DEX with order book, matching engine, AMM fallback, and router
> - Real functionality, not a toy example
>
> **Hardhat 3 features:**
> - Full ES Module migration
> - New plugin architecture
> - EDR simulated network
> - Node 22 compatibility
>
> **Arcology parallel execution:**
> - Storage-slot level parallelism
> - 562 TPS locally, 23 TPS on Arcology
> - Zero conflicts with concurrent writes
>
> **Key decisions:**
> - Price levels as separate storage slots - that's what enables parallelism
> - U256Cumulative for counters - prevents race conditions
> - Hardhat 3 migration took 4 hours due to plugin dependency hell
> - Node 22 is mandatory, not optional
>
> All documentation is in the repo. This qualifies for both the Hardhat 3 Bounty and Arcology's hackathon.
>
> Thanks for watching!"
